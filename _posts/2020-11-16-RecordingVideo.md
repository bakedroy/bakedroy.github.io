Recording video presentation is really hard work for me because I'm not a professional of video editing.
I never know how to record video and I found recording by Zoom is the easiest tool.
Recording by Zoom is not a hard work because it's UI is good. One problem is that I cannot find how to save the video.
After starting the meeting, push the record button to start recording, and then push the stop button to stop recording.
But the video is not saved. To save the video, stop the meeting. Then Zoom starts saving of recorded video in mp4 format.
The video is well compressed so the file size is really small.
